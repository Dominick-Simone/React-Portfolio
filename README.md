# React Portfolio

## Description
This is my ReactJS Portfolio that shows my accomplishments as a programmer. It includes projects I've completed, a section about me as a developer, and links to my LinkedIn, Github, and my Resume. It also shows all of the different technologies, programming languages, and tools that I have learned while developing.
